# Windows bootloader

### Create Boot Entry (EFI + BIOS)

You can create a manual boot entry with bcdedit. For example, to add `systemd-boot`...

```shell
bcdedit /set "{bootmgr}" path \EFI\systemd\systemd-bootx64.efi
```

#### Rebuild Bootloader (EFI)

I really hate that Microsoft adds a useless 16MB partition after the EFI partition, even if it is 'required'.
However, it can be deleted with no impact... Aside from borking the boot loader.
Therefore, if you delete it, reorder partitons or anything that screws with the bootloader, you can boot a windows install image and run these commands.

```powershell
diskpart # Check to make sure that EFI and Windows are mapped
- list vol
- sel vol X
- assign letter A:

bcdboot C:\Windows /l en-gb /s A: /f UEFI
```
