# Field Manual

A personal knowledge repository, based on the 'Red Team Field Manual'. Intended to be an offline-first knowledge repository and cheat sheet.

## Formatting

- This repository follows Github flavoured markdown primarily, and uses wikilinks for linking to other resources.
- It is supposed to be easy to use within `vscode`, `zed` and `obsidian`.

## TODO / Tracking

A list of things to create, research, study and the sort. Removed once completed.

- [ ] Creating a proxy chain with `squid` to forward internet access to a target.
- [ ] Setting up a simple `wireguard` based network pivot.
- [ ] Using `script $hostname.log` to log actions performed on a box.
- [ ] `systemd-repart`, in particular to expand root filesystem.
